Multiple threads can cause problems called "concurrency issues": these happen when
threads read and write variables at the same time, causing the threads to trip over
each other. Concurrency issues can be hard to reproduce consistently, making them
hard to debug.
To avoid concurrency issues, never let multiple threads read or write the same
variables. When I create a new Thread object, make sure its target function uses
only local variables in that function.
