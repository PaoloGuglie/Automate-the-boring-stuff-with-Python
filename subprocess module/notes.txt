If I have multiple instances of an application open, each of thoes instances is a separate
process of the same program.

Every process can have multiple threads. Unlike threads, a process cannot directly read
and write another process's variables.

I can pass commain line arguments to processes I create with Popen(). To do so, I pass
a list as the sole argument to Popen(). The first element is the executable, the others
are the command line arguments to pass. In effect, this list will be the value of sys.argv
for the launched program.
